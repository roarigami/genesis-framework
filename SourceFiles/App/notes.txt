For autoloader to work:
The class name must be the same as the file name
If class has a different extension like .core.php
it will need a separate autloader function for that extension

// Check if class exists
if(class_exists('GenFrame\Database\Migrations\UsersTable')){
  echo "Class EXISTS";
} else {
  echo "Class does not exist";
}
